# API Best Practices

## General Guidelines
Follow these best practices when integrating with our API:

## Authentication
1. Store tokens securely (HttpOnly cookies, secure storage)
2. Implement token refresh before expiration
3. Don't expose tokens in URLs or client-side code
4. Revoke tokens when no longer needed

## Request Design
1. Use proper HTTP methods:
   - GET for retrieving data
   - POST for creating resources
   - PUT for replacing resources
   - PATCH for updating resources
   - DELETE for removing resources
2. Include versioned endpoints in all requests
3. Set appropriate Content-Type headers
4. Keep request payloads minimal

## Error Handling
1. Implement appropriate error handling for all status codes
2. Use exponential backoff for rate limit errors
3. Log detailed error information for debugging
4. Display user-friendly error messages

## Performance
1. Cache responses when appropriate
2. Minimize the number of API calls
3. Use pagination for large result sets
4. Implement partial responses for large resources
5. Use compression for request/response bodies

## Security
1. Always use HTTPS
2. Validate all inputs
3. Implement proper CORS settings for browser clients
4. Use the principle of least privilege (request minimal scopes)

## Versioning
1. Include API version in all requests
2. Monitor for version deprecation notices
3. Plan for version migrations
4. Test against the specific API version you're targeting
